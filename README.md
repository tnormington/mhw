# Monster Hunter World Database

This is a UI to thumb through all items in the Monster Hunter World database. Currently I only have the weapons list working, but I plan to add armor and monsters soon. I get all of the data from [this API](https://docs.mhw-db.com/), I want to extend a huge thanks to [Tyler Lartonoix](https://github.com/LartTyler) for building that. And some of the images are pulled from the [MHW Wiki](https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Monster+Hunter+World+Wiki).

Right now the data is in a static JSON object until I build my own API, something I hope to do soon.
